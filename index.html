        <h2><em>Greetings <code>HTML</code> and Food Enjoyers!</em></h2>
        <p class="mini-heading">Welcome to yet <strong>ANOTHER</strong> <code>HTML</code> creation of mine!</p>
        <p class="pborder">You might've thought my last website was <em>"well-made"</em> for a fifteen year old kid, well this is even <strong>better!</strong> As you can see, Bootstrap & Box Model are being utilized to make this website look <em>mouthwateringly sexy!</em> Just as moutherwatering as the food you will see in this "tour"! In this website shenanigan, you will learn about what are (in my opinion) <strong>The Grandest Restaurants in the city of Amman, Jordan!</strong> If you do not live in Amman or have never even heard of the place in your life until now, you can read on if you'd like, but I suggest you learn more about Amman <a href=https://international.visitjordan.com/Wheretogo/Amman>here</a> then make plans to visit it! But for those who live in Amman, or are already planning on visiting it, welcome! I hope you stick around as these restaurants are <strong>seriously</strong> incredible! Some are quite fancy and will make your wallet cry, but are definitely worth it for your tastebuds! I will feature restuarants with <strong>fantastic</strong> Arab food, some burgers in case you want to be safe, and maybe other cuisines... </p>

        <p style="width: 60%;left: 10px;border: dashed 4px brown;padding: 6px;">Notice how they have very intersting names? Not just <em>bUrGerS aNd mOrE,</em>that's how you already <strong>KNOW</strong> there is more to these restauarants than meets the eye! We will explore firstly the <em>exiquisite</em> Italian restaurant <u><strong>Le Gemelle</strong></u> that feautures delicious pastas and pizzas. Then, we will mellow it out with <u><strong>Burgerizz</strong></u> that features probably the best chicken I've had in Amman. And afterwards, we will finally conclude with a magnificent restaurant that is quite hefty in cost, but quite a bang for your buck: <u><strong>Majdoline,</strong></u> which features <strong>oustanding</strong> Arab cuisine that you should absolutely try,(kebabs, mansaf, hummus, etc!) I think at this point I'm just wasting your time, let's get this party started!</p>

        <p class="mini-heading" id="mini_me"><span style="background-color:darkgray">A little about me...</span></p>
        <p class="box-right" id="about_me">You have probably questioned my qualifications on being a food critic, and don't get me wrong you have the right to do so, why would you listen to some fifteen year old kid on what to eat? Well, let me briefly introduce myself: Hi! I am Muhammad, I am about to turn fifteen on March 17th (it's March 4th as I write this), I was born in the United States, but have lived in Jordan for a majority of my life, and basically all my relatives are Jordanian, and that's all you need to know. I have eaten and sampled many foods in Jordan, so I can say with certainty that these restaurants are one of the best and highest quality in Amman. So in short, I know what I am doing. You can trust me! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8hvyjZWHs&t=2s&ab_channel=TheVilkaz">I am an engineer!</a></p>
