          <em>Did ya notice the extra content on this page? Trust me, this restaurant is an absolute beaut' mate.</em> Anyway, welcome to the third and last part of this expedition, journey, shenanigan, <s>rubbish, waste of time</s> we will be exploring another rather fancy restaurant, but this time it is one that aligns with Jordan's cuisine more closely, <strong>Lebanese!</strong> Lebanese cuisine features many classic Arabian and Mediterranean dishes, and Majdoline indeed features many of those dishes, such as Kibbeh, Kuftah, Kebab, and even Shawerma! The variations of these dishes that Majdoline has, believe me, do NOT disappoint, they indeed capture Lebanese and Arab cuisine in an artful and flavorful way that I <em>subjectively</em> believe no other place does! The setting of the place also creates a soothing and fancy atmosphere that makes you feel like a king, and the presentation of the food makes it even more appetizing and therefore allows you to enjoy the food and restaurant even more! Once you see the menu, you may or may not gawk at the astonishing prices, but I <strong>assure</strong> you it is worth at least trying once! Anyway, enough with the blabbing, let's end this tour off with a <strong style="font-size: x-large">BANG!</strong> </p>

      <p class="box-right" id="bcorner" style="width: 45%;">Majdoline as mentioned is a restaurant with an Arabian/Mediterranean cuisine (or lebanese), it also is located around the center of Amman, where it will be to most people who live/visit Amman, and it has many dishes from that cuisine, such as Kebab in the form of a <strong>Mixed Grill,</strong> featuring kebab, and meat and chicken cubes, Kubeh being <strong>Fried Kubeh,</strong> being minced meat covered in a blend of cracked wheat, and shawerma which has been reformed to be <strong>unique</strong> and <strong>flavorful</strong> being <strong>Shawerma Cake</strong>! All these dishes mentioned are most certainly worth trying, but unfortunately I have only been able to experience this restaurant once, and I was not able to sample much of the food that they have to offer, but amongst the food I was able to sample I have some favorites that are worth mentioning and I believe you should indeed try eating! However, remember that I am a fifteen year old at the end of the day, so I may not critique these <strong>magnificent</strong> foods accurately, and my taste is not a golden stamp per se, so take my recommendations with a <em>grain of salt.</em> Nontheless, here are my three dishes that I found to be my favorites, this time around, there are <em>two dishes</em> and <strong>one desert!</strong></p>

        <p class="box-center" style="border: 4px dashed brown; border-radius: 25px; padding: 6px;width: 75%;">But WAIT a minute... before look at the food, can we just take a moment to appreciate the restaurant's atmosphere? Just look at the images above, I was not able to take many pictures from the restaurant, but I was able to take these nice photos, and I mean, <strong>WaW.</strong> Don't worry, I won't take much time on the setting, but this restaurant is special and it is simply worth appreciating for just a moment. The tables when you sit down are neat covered in proper cloth, and the cuttlery is neatly placed in a wrapped cloth, and the cups are placed in an aesthetic way. But what's special is that ths restaurant has a <strong>piano!</strong> It looks really nice and decorates the entrance quite nicely. Also, the walls are not overwhelming but rather are colored in a way to enhance the subtle beuty of this restaurant, and the art is really cool! I personally really liked the one I took an image of, the bottom ones in particular, as they fit with the Lebanese an Arab theme of the restaurant! Also, the restaurant when I went to it had these capsules with fire at the bottom, which I found pretty nice. In short, fantastic atmosphere, which made the restaurant feel nicer, making the food in a way <em>taste</em> better!</p>

        <p class="box-center" style="border: 4px dashed brown; border-radius: 25px; padding: 6px;width: 75%; left: 12%">Anyway, the moment you've been <s>or not been</s> waiting for: <strong style="font-size: larger">The Food!</strong> The dishes above, being Kubeh Nayeh, Shawerma Cake, and Tamriyeh, are what truly made this restaurant <strong>incredible</strong> and <em>one of a kind!</em> All of them had a unique taste that is simply unlike what my puny, teenage tastebuds have tasted before, and had a flavor that made my tastebuds dance <em>amongst the stars!</em> For instance, the Kubeh Nayeh had <em>raw</em> beef, which makes it already quite interesting, but it had a very nice creamy texture, allowing to dissolve in your mouth, and having an interesting flavor! But that was just an appetizer, the real deal was in the Shawerma Cake! Ohhh man was that <strong>great!</strong> Shawerma in of itself is just <em>fantastic,</em> but I have never seen anything like this, the bread that typically coats a shawerma was instead in this <strong>potato,</strong> but nontheless it felt nice and thick, coating the beef like a <strong>cake,</strong> which enchanced its flavor, and the beef itself was high in quality, having just the right texture and seasoning, and the sauce boosted everything, giving more unique flavor and making this an awesome dish! And finally, the desert, what a way to end off things, it had a very nice cruch, and along with that it had powder sugar that felt subtle but gave a nice sweetness to everything, and the content inside made the desert <strong>pop</strong> with flavor! Overall, just phenomenal food. </p>

        <p class="box-center" style="border: solid 4px brown;color: brown;font-size: larger;background-color: darkgray;">In conclusion, Majdoline is indeed a magnificent and is probably one the best restaurants I've ever visted thus far (as of writing this) in Amman! The location is quite accessible to most people who live in the city, the setting is very elegant and sets an appropriate and soft atmosphere, and the dishes are indeed falvorful and are presented in unique and appetizing ways, msot notably of which is the Shawerma Cake, which is given plenty of glamour before being set on the table, and is indeed magnificent in flavor. Although this restaurant may have hefty price tags, I subjectively think it is worth the price for the experience and the food, maybe not everyday, but atleast once, or once every now and then. With all that in mind, Majdoline is the #1 <strong><em>Grandest Resaurant in Amman!</em></strong> Earning a near perfect 9.5/10. And with that concludes out tour, with a <strong style="font-size: x-large">BANG!</strong> </p>
